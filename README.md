# DataScienceFinalProject

In this project, we analyzed the [bookcrossing dataset](http://www2.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~cziegler/BX/). The dataset contains three CSV files which are ratings, users, and books. We explored the data and preprocessed it. We applied a dimesionaltiy reduction technique (PCA), three classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors), and two clustering algorithms (K-Means and Hierarchical) to build models from the dataset. Our project contains the following parts:

- Dataset
- Exploratory data analysis
- Visualization techniques
- Imbalanced data set
- Missing data imputation
- Multicollinearity
- Logistic Regression
- PCA
  - PCA with Logistic Regression
- Clustering
  - K-Means Clustering
  - Hierarchical Clustering
    - Missing Data with Hierarchical Clustering
- Classification
  - Decision Tree
    - Decision tree with imbalanced data
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)
